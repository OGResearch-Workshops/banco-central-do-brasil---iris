# Judgmental adjustments in (semi-)structural models

##### Reduced-form vs structural judgmental adjustments

* Reduced-form = specify a path for an endogenous variables, and back out the shocks necessary
* Structural = enter the shock values directly

##### Reduced-form adjustments: Exactly determined vs underdetermined

* Exactly determined reduced-form adjustments (number of exogenized data points==number of endogenized data points): one unique solution
* Underdetermined reduced-form adjustments aka proper conditioning (number of exogenized data points<number of endogenized data points): discriminate between multiple (infinitely many) solutions using e.g. sum of squares of normalized shocks
* Practical trick to mimick underdetermined reduced-form adjustments

##### Anticipated vs unanticipated judgmental adjustments

##### Hard tunes vs soft tunes in reduced-form adjustments

* Hard tunes means reproduce the exogenized path exactly
* Soft tunes means we give some weight to our adjustments
