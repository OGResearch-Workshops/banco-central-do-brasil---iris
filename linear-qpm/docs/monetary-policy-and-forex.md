3. Any "linear combination" in bewteen

## Exchange rate managment in semi-structural model

* Uncovered interest parity with an implied exchange rate

$$
 r_t - r^\mathrm{ww}_t
- prem_t 
= 4 \left( ex_t^\mathrm{ste} - ex_t^\mathrm{uip} \right)
$$

* The actual exchange rate is affected by forex interventions

* The extent of forex interventions is determined by $q_5\in(0,1)$: $q_5=1$ means a fixed exchange rate, $q_5=0$ means a float

$$
ex_t = q_5 \, ex_t^\mathrm{tar} + (1 - q_5) \, ex_t^\mathrm{uip}
$$

* We measure the extent of forex interventions by

$$
int_t = ex_t^\mathrm{uip} - ex_t
$$

* Local currency interest supports the managed exchange rate framework

$$
r_t = r_t^\mathrm{tar} + q_4 \, \left( ex_t^\mathrm{uip} - ex_t \right)
$$
