# Model-based Macroeconomic Projections

__Workshop for the Central Bank of Brazil__


## Preliminary program

The workshop will be organized in a total of ten three-hour daily sessions within the weeks of May 9–13 and May 16–20, 2022.

* The main topics will be first introduced at a basic theoretical/conceptual level
* The practical illustrations will be based on a variety of actual models and data

### Week 1: May 9–13, 2022

#### Monday 

> Overview of Iris Toolbox functionality
> 
> * Structural modeling (`Model`, `Plan`, `Explanatory`, `LinearSystem`)
> * Time series modeling (`VAR`, `SVAR`, `+dummy`, `PanelVAR`, `Armani`, `ParArmani`)
> * Data and time series management (`Series`, `+databank`, `Dater`)
> * Interfaces for external data sources (IMF, Fred, ECB)
> * Visualization and reporting (`+databank.Chartpack`, `+rephrase`)
> * Estimation (`SystemProperty`, `SystemPrior`, `Posterior`)
> * Kalman filtering (`Kalman`)

#### Tuesday
