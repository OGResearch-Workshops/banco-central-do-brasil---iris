# Setup instructions

## Overview of requirements/dependencies

* Matlab R2019b or later

* Git, a version control system

* Local clone of the Iris Toolbox repository: the latest `bleeding` branch

* Local clone of the workshop repository: the latest `master` branch


## Install Git

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com) (a version control system) locally on
your computer. This may require assistance by your IT department.

## Create a folder for the workshop

Choose and create a directory (folder) within which you will maintain two subfolders: one for the Iris
Toolbox and the other for the workshop files; for instance `C:\Users\Marcos\wokshop-2022` on Windows, or
`~/workshop-2022` on Linux/macOS.

Make sure the path is not overly complicated (this is in your own
interest:) and does not contain blank spaces (use underscores or dashes
instead).
